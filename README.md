- Displays weather for popular climbing areas
  - Uses weather.gov to pull weather info
  - Displays overall weather forecast, temperature, precipitation, and wind
- Use a database (maybe not necessary, but I want to learn how to use one)
  - Store climbing area information
  - Possibly create user database so they can have favorite climbing areas

Stretch Requirments:

  - Show climbing areas, click on them to preview weather
  - Put home location and select distance to see weather at climbing areas
    within certain distance
